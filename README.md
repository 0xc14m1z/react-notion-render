# Sample React/Notion render

This repo contains sample implementations for rendering Notion blocks with React.

It's not a package, which means that this is not a ready to use code, but more something to take inspiration from, maybe copy-paste it, but for sure adapted to your use case.
It doesn't cover the implementation of all the available blocks, but only the ones I personally used.
There's no styling, because that of course will differ all the time.

I wrote how I used this code in [this blog post](https://blog.luca.ramundo.dev/notion-as-cms-for-nextjs).
